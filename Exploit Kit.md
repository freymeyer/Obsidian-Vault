# Exploit Kit

> **One-liner:** An automated software toolkit that probes victims' browsers for vulnerabilities and delivers malware without user interaction.

## 🎯 What Is It?
An Exploit Kit (EK) is a pre-packaged collection of exploits designed to automatically identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a victim's system—typically through their web browser or browser plugins. Exploit kits are used in the **Weaponization** and **Delivery** stages of the [[Cyber Kill Chain]].

## 🔬 How It Works

```
1. Traffic Redirection
   └── Victim visits compromised/malicious site
   └── Redirected to exploit kit landing page (via iframe, malvertising, etc.)

2. Fingerprinting  
   └── EK identifies browser, OS, plugins, versions
   └── Checks for vulnerable software (Flash, Java, PDF reader)

3. Exploit Selection
   └── Selects appropriate exploit for detected vulnerabilities
   └── May try multiple exploits in sequence

4. Payload Delivery
   └── Exploit triggers, downloads/executes malware
   └── Typically ransomware, banking trojans, or RATs

5. Post-Exploitation
   └── Malware establishes persistence
   └── Connects to [[Command and Control (C2)|C2]] server
```

## 📊 Notable Exploit Kits

| Exploit Kit | Active Period | Notable Traits |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Angler** | 2013-2016 | Most sophisticated, fileless infections |
| **RIG** | 2014-present | Still active, JavaScript-based |
| **Magnitude** | 2013-present | Targets Asia, delivers ransomware |
| **Nuclear** | 2009-2016 | Highly evasive, large market share |
| **Blackhole** | 2010-2013 | Pioneered the EK-as-a-service model |

## 🛡️ Detection & Prevention

### How to Detect
- Monitor for suspicious iframe injections
- Network traffic analysis for known EK domains/patterns
- Endpoint behavioral monitoring (unusual process spawning from browsers)
- Sandbox analysis of suspicious redirects

### How to Prevent / Mitigate
- **Patch management** - Keep browsers and plugins updated
- Disable unnecessary plugins (Flash, Java, Silverlight)
- Use modern browsers with built-in exploit mitigations
- Deploy [[Web Application Firewalls (WAFS)|WAFs]] and web filtering
- Enable browser sandboxing features
- Ad blockers to prevent [[Malvertising]]

## 🎤 Interview Angles

### Common Questions
- "What is an exploit kit and how does it work?"
- "How would you detect exploit kit activity on a network?"
- "Why have exploit kits declined in popularity?"

### Key Talking Points
- EKs are "drive-by download" attacks—no user interaction needed
- Decline due to browser security improvements and Flash deprecation
- Still relevant for unpatched systems and targeted attacks

## ✅ Best Practices
- Enforce automatic updates across all endpoints
- Use browser isolation for high-risk users
- Block known malicious domains at DNS level
- Regular vulnerability scanning of client systems
