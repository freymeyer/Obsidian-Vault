Vulnerability chaining is when two or more individual weaknesses are combined to cause greater damage than they could alone. Think of it like this: one vulnerability gets your foot in the door, another gives you access to sensitive functionality, and a third might let you execute code or exfiltrate data. None of them are particularly dangerous on their own, but together, they're powerful.

## Methodology
### How to Think Like an Attacker
A skilled attacker rarely finds a single vulnerability and immediately wins. Instead, they explore the application like a curious user, identify small cracks, and slowly build up a path to their objective. The real power of chaining vulnerabilities comes from understanding how they interact, not just spotting them in isolation.

This section introduces a repeatable process to help you think like an attacker. You'll learn how to map out an application, identify potential weaknesses, and combine them to achieve a larger goal, just like an adversary would.

#### Step 1: Use the Application Like a Normal User
Before anything else, explore the application with no assumptions. Register an account, log in, click around, and understand what features are available. Don't go hunting for bugs yet. Just get a feel for the flow, the user roles, and where sensitive actions happen (e.g. account settings, admin features, uploads).

#### Step 2: Enumerate and Find Weaknesses
Now shift your focus to identifying weak spots. These might be classic vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, or [[Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)]], or subtler behaviours like inconsistent error messages, user ID patterns in URLs, or file uploads that allow weird extensions.

At this point, list all potential findings, even if they seem low-risk.

#### Step 3: Understand What Each Finding Enables
Once you've got a handful of weaknesses, assess them in isolation. Ask yourself:
"What can I do with this if I assume nothing else is broken?"

Does this XSS run in a useful context?
Can this verbose login help with username enumeration?
Will this file upload let me drop a script somewhere?
You're trying to understand the standalone potential of each issue.

#### Step 4: Think Like an Attacker, What's the Goal?
Now ask: What would an attacker want to do with this application?

Steal sensitive data?
Access an admin panel?
Escalate to remote code execution?
Context matters. An XSS on a blog might be annoying, but on a banking dashboard? That's a very different threat.

#### Step 5: Build a Path from Weaknesses to Objective
This is where you connect the dots. Look at your list of vulnerabilities and imagine a logical path from an external user to the attacker's goal.

Example:

Verbose login → valid usernames → weak password policy → login → stored XSS → admin visits → XSS fires → admin cookie theft → privilege escalation

The key is mapping out the exploit path step by step.

#### Step 6: Execute and Validate Each Step
Walk the chain in order. Don't assume something will work; test it.

Can you brute-force a password?
Does your XSS trigger in the right context?
Will the stolen cookie actually let you access the admin dashboard?
This also helps uncover blockers or dependencies. Maybe the XSS only works on certain pages, or the login brute-force fails because of rate limiting.

#### Step 7: Report the Full Chain
When reporting, don't isolate the bugs. Tell the full story.

Start with "an unauthenticated attacker can do X", and walk through the chain clearly. Make it obvious that the risk comes not from one bug, but from how they interact.

Also, be clear about the impact escalation:
"While each individual issue might be low or medium risk, together they result in full compromise of the system."


## When the Chain Isn't Linear
Suppose the application did have CSRF tokens in place and your attempt to change the admin's email silently failed. Does this make your XSS useless? Far from it. A creative attacker wouldn't give up; they'd think about what else that XSS could do. Could you steal the admin's session cookie? Could you trick them into making a GET request that leaks sensitive information through a different vector? Could you use it to fingerprint what browser or plugins the admin uses, or force their browser to carry out another action on your behalf?

This is where the attacker mindset shines through. The question isn't "does this work as I planned?" but "what else can I do with the access I have?"

Experienced attackers always think in terms of pivot points. When you plan out a chain, don't just focus on one path to success. Think about alternatives if part of your plan fails. If the CSRF trick doesn't work, can you use XSS in a different way? If SQLi isn't exploitable for auth bypass, could it still dump useful data that helps with password guessing?

A good habit is to mentally map out, or even sketch, the different pivots and fallback options as you discover them. This helps you stay structured in your approach, even when the target doesn't behave how you expect.

## [[Red Teaming]] vs [[Bug Bounty]]: Different Endgames
It's also worth understanding that your goal can shape how you think about chaining. On a red team engagement, your job is to demonstrate impact holistically. You want to follow the chain as far as you can, ideally reaching your objective (such as domain admin or sensitive data access) without being detected. This means you might actually use your chain to pivot into internal systems, move laterally, or establish persistence.

On a bug bounty, the goal is different. Your job is to clearly show the risk and potential impact so the company can fix it. Sometimes, that means stopping before full exploitation because the report itself is enough to prove the point. For example, showing that you could change the admin's email or that you could dump user data through SQLi is usually enough, you don't need to go further.

|Aspect|Red Team Engagement|Bug Bounty Program|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary Goal**|Demonstrate real-world impact, identify gaps in the organisation's security posture|Communicate risk clearly to the vendor|
|**Chaining**|Used to pivot, escalate, and achieve access|Used to show how multiple bugs combine|
|**Execution Style**|Stealthy, often avoids detection|Transparent, designed to be reproducible|
|**End Objective**|Achieve defined goal (e.g., data exfil, DA)|Submit a valid, impactful report|
|**Level of Exploitation**|Full chain executed if possible|Partial exploitation is fine if risk is clear|
|**PoC Quality**|May use real tools or simulate ops activity|Requires clean, minimal, and safe reproduction|
