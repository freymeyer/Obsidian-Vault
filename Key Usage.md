The core purpose of cryptographic keys is their use in encrypting data, authenticating users and devices, and securing communication. During the usage phase, monitoring and controlling how, when, and by whom the keys are utilised is vital. This oversight helps prevent unauthorised use and ensures that keys are used for their designated purposes. Access control is super important here.

## Access Control Mechanisms
- [[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)]]
- [[Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)]]

## Authentication
- [[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)]]

## Accountability
**Auditing and Monitoring**
- **Key to security:** Continuously monitoring access to cryptographic keys and auditing key usage are essential for detecting unauthorised access attempts and ensuring compliance with security policies.
- **Tools:** Implement logging and monitoring tools that provide real-time alerts and comprehensive audit trails for all access and operations performed on cryptographic keys.
