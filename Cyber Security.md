## Cyber Security Training
How would you master any skill? By practice and training. Cyber security is no different. Nobody is born a cyber security expert; everyone needs to gain the relevant skills and work diligently to keep them up to date and build upon them. However, practising what you learn in cyber security has certain requirements. Example: it usually involves setting up a computer lab environment to ensure the setup won’t harm production systems. This is why training platforms are indispensable in your journey to becoming a “master.”

You might have heard the saying, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” and cyber security is no different. When responsible for system security, it is better to learn in a training environment than during a live incident. Moreover, proper training increases the quality of the cyber security team’s work and, therefore, reduces the likelihood of incidents.

The real power of training from an organisation’s perspective is that it increases the team’s capacity without hiring additional team members. **The main reason is that it prepares the team to handle what will come their way. Instead of learning new concepts, techniques, and tools in the middle of a cyber attack, they have come prepared.**

Training makes it feasible to hire junior people and give them the means to ramp up quickly. Training also decreases the effort required by senior staff to train the same material over and over again.

Centralised training creates a common baseline within an organisation to assess skills, knowledge, and their development. Instead of vague terms like “junior” or “senior,” employees’ skills can be described more specifically. This makes it easier to make informed decisions when assigning tasks to an employee or a team. Insights into an employee’s current skills also clarify the path they must follow to take the next step.

Finally, training can be fun and can foster teamwork. For instance, the experience of being part of a team playing a CTF (Capture the Flag) challenge builds incredible friendships, which will help when needed.

## Calculating the Financial Impact of Training

To calculate the financial impact of training, we will consider the following case:

- **Situation**: A cyber security team has **ten** employees
- **Cost**: Each employee costs **$80,000** annually
- **Assumption**: Training increases productivity by **4%**

Knowing that one employee costs $80,000 annually and that we have ten employees, then the savings (gains) due to the training of ten employees are $32,000 (10 × 4% × $80,000).

Assuming that the cost of training is $500 per employee, the total cost is $5,000 (10 × $500 = $5,000).

It is easy now to show that the Return On Investment (ROI) is 640% ($32,000/$5,000 = 640%).
