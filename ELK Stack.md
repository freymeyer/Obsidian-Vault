The ELK stack is an acronym used to describe a stack that comprises three popular projects: [[Elasticsearch]], [[Logstash]], and [[Kibana]]. 

The ELK stack gives you the ability to aggregate logs from all your systems and applications, analyze these logs, and create visualizations for application and infrastructure monitoring, faster troubleshooting, security analytics, and more.
