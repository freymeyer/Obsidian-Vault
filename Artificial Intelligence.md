Artificial Intelligence is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human behaviour, like learning and reasoning.

A field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that usually need human thinking, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.

## Cyber Security Relevance
- Processing large amounts of data - Analysing big data from multiple types of sources like system and network logs
- Behaviour analysis - Tracking normal behaviour and activities and then flagging anything that's abnormal
- Generative AI - Summarising context behind a series of events

### Defensive Security
AI agents are being used in blue teaming to speed up detection, investigation, and response, making them quicker and more dependable. Acting like automated assistants, these agents continuously process telemetry (logs, network flows, endpoint signals) and add context to alerts. Furthermore, we are witnessing the integration of AI into vendor appliances—such as AI-assisted firewalling and intrusion detection systems.

Beyond just detecting threats, AI can also assist in automating responses. Picture your system automatically isolating an infected device, blocking a suspicious email, or flagging an unusual login attempt — all in real time.

### Offensive Security
AI agents have made a notable impact on offensive security by automating and handling the often very labourious and time-consuming tasks that a pentester might traditionally undertake. 

For example, AI can be a powerful tool in a penetration tester's workflow for reconnaissance and information gathering, from OSINT to analysing noisy scanner outputs and mapping attack surfaces. This allows the pentester to spend more time on the crucial tasks that require a human touch.

### Software
AI-driven software development, rightfully, sounds a bit frightening. Isn't that so? Well, you wouldn't be wrong to feel this way; we've all heard about the popularity of [[Vibe Coding]] and the vulnerabilities introduced by AI.

However, AI has proven to be a valuable addition to the software development process in several ways. One example is a virtual "colleague" to bounce ideas off while writing the code itself. More importantly, it is used as a [[Static Application Security Testing (SAST)]] / [[Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)]] scanner. These scanners audit and analyse written code and applications for potential vulnerabilities. 

Yes, it's somewhat ironic. AI agents can be great at identifying vulnerabilities, but are not quite as effective at writing secure code.
