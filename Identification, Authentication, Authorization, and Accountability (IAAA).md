is a simple way to think about how users and their actions are verified on applications. Each item plays a crucial role and it isn't possible to skip a level. That means, if a previous item isn't being performed, you cannot perform the later times. The four items are:

- **Identity** - the unique account (e.g., user ID/email) that represents a person or service.
- **Authentication** - proving that identity (passwords, OTP, passkeys).
- **Authorisation** - what that identity is allowed to do.
- **Accountability** - recording and alerting on who did what, when, and from where.
