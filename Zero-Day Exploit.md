# Zero-Day Exploit

> **One-liner:** An exploit targeting a vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor, meaning no patch exists at the time of attack.

## 🎯 What Is It?
A Zero-Day Exploit leverages a security vulnerability that has not yet been discovered or patched by the software vendor. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that developers have had **zero days** to fix the issue. These exploits are part of the **Exploitation** stage of the [[Cyber Kill Chain]] and are highly valuable in the threat landscape.

## 🔬 How It Works

### Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Zero-Day Vulnerability** | The unknown flaw itself |
| **Zero-Day Exploit** | Code that exploits the vulnerability |
| **Zero-Day Attack** | Use of the exploit against real targets |
| **N-Day Exploit** | Exploit for known vulnerability (patch exists) |

## 📊 Why They Matter

- **No Defense:** Traditional signature-based detection fails
- **High Value:** Sold on black market for $10K–$2.5M+
- **APT Favorite:** Used by nation-states and advanced groups
- **Low Detection:** Difficult to identify without behavioral analysis

### Zero-Day Market

| Buyer Type | Price Range | Motivation |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Vendors (Bug Bounty) | $500 - $150K | Fix vulnerabilities |
| Governments | $50K - $2.5M+ | Offensive operations |
| Black Market | $10K - $500K+ | Cybercrime, APT |

## 🛡️ Detection & Prevention

### How to Detect
- **Behavioral analysis** - Detect anomalous behavior, not signatures
- **[[Endpoint detection and response (EDR)|EDR]]** - Monitor for suspicious process chains
- **Sandboxing** - Analyze suspicious files in isolated environments
- **Threat intelligence** - Correlate with known threat actor TTPs
- **Honeypots** - Detect exploitation attempts in decoy systems

### How to Prevent / Mitigate
- **Defense in depth** - Multiple security layers
- **Application allowlisting** - Only approved software runs
- **Least privilege** - Limit damage from successful exploits
- **Network segmentation** - Contain lateral movement
- **Virtual patching** - [[Web Application Firewalls (WAFS)|WAF]]/[[Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)|IPS]] rules to block exploitation
- **Rapid patching** - Minimize window for N-day attacks

## 🎤 Interview Angles

### Common Questions
- "What is a zero-day and how does it differ from a known vulnerability?"
- "How would you protect against zero-day attacks?"
- "Why are zero-days valuable to threat actors?"

### STAR Story
> **Situation:** [[Log4Shell]] zero-day (CVE-2021-44228) was publicly disclosed.
> **Task:** Protect the organization before an official patch was available.
> **Action:** Immediately applied virtual patching via WAF rules, disabled JNDI lookups where possible, conducted asset inventory to identify vulnerable systems, and monitored for exploitation attempts.
> **Result:** No successful exploitation occurred despite active targeting. Formal patches applied within 72 hours of release.

## ✅ Best Practices
- Assume breach—focus on detection and response, not just prevention
- Participate in bug bounty programs (reduce your own zero-day exposure)
- Implement robust logging for forensic capability
- Subscribe to threat intelligence feeds
- Practice rapid response through tabletop exercises
