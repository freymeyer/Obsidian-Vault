Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3) is an alternative protocol for receiving emails that downloads emails from the server to a local device. Using POP3, a recipient cannot access their emails again from a different device because they are stored locally and then deleted from the email server.

- Emails are downloaded and stored on a single device.
- Sent messages are stored on the single device from which the email was sent.
- Emails can only be accessed from the single device the emails were downloaded to.
- If you want to keep messages on the server, make sure the setting "Keep email on server" is enabled, or all messages are deleted from the server once downloaded to the single device's app or software.
