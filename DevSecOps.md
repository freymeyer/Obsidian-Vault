Fosters the same culture and principles as Devops with the addition of security into the development process, ensuring security is integrated from an early stage.

## The Importance of Cryptographic Keys
At the heart of securing digital information lies the management of cryptographic keys. These keys serve as the cornerstone for encrypting sensitive data, authenticating users and devices, and ensuring the integrity of communication channels. In DevSecOps, managing these keys is vital to safeguarding the entire development and operations pipeline. ﻿

## Integrating Security Practices Early
The DevSecOps framework is known for its approach to integrating security practices early in the development lifecycle. This proactive strategy is crucial for preventing security breaches, mitigating data loss, and circumventing compliance issues before they arise. This room will explore how integrating key management processes early in development can lead to a more secure and efficient pipeline.

## Regulatory and Compliance Standards
Navigating the requirements of regulatory & compliance is a challenge for any organisation. Standards such as the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss/) (PCI DSS), [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR), and the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/resources/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-of-1996-hipaa.html) (HIPAA) outline strict guidelines for the protection of sensitive data. Adherence to these regulations is not optional but critical for organisations to avoid hefty fines and legal repercussions. In this context, effective key management is not just a security measure, but a compliance mandate.
