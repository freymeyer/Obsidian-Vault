The concept of creating multiple virtual environments from shared physical hardware. Virtualisation allows multiple operating systems to run on a physical device, where the operating systems do not interact or conflict with each other. These multiple environments are known as [[Virtual Machines (VMs)]]. Hosts that provide virtualisation are known as [[Hypervisors]].
