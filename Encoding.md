Encoding is a method to transform data to ensure compatibility between different systems. It differs from encryption in purpose and process.

|              | Encoding                     | Encryption                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Compatibility  <br>Usability | Security  <br>Confidentiality |
| **Process**  | Standardized                 | Algorithm + Key               |
| **Security** | No                           | Yes                           |
| **Speed**    | Fast                         | Slow                          |
| **Examples** | Base64                       | TLS                           |
