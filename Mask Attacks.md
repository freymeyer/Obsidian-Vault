Brute-force and mask attacks go one step further. A brute-force attack systematically tries every possible combination of characters until it finds the right one. While this guarantees success eventually, the time it takes grows exponentially with the length and complexity of the password.

Mask attacks aim to reduce that time by limiting guesses to a specific format. For example, trying all combinations of three lowercase letters followed by two digits.

By narrowing the search space, mask attacks strike a balance between speed and thoroughness, especially when the attacker has some idea of how the password might be structured.
