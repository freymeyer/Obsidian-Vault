Palantir developed the ADS Framework to provide a guideline for documenting detection content. A significant challenge faced by security teams, and Palantir being no exception, is alert fatigue and apathy, mainly caused by poor means of developing and implementing detection alerts that would result in effective incident response and mitigation. The ADS Framework seeks to address this challenge and provide a guideline for constructing effective detections and alerts.  

The ADS Framework has a strict flow that detection engineers must follow before publishing detection rules into production. The stages involved are:

1. **Goal:** Describes the intended reasons for setting up the alert and the type of behaviour that needs to be detected.
    
2. **Categorisation:** Mapping the detection to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to provide analysts with information on the TTPs for investigation and areas of the kill chain where the ADS will be used.
    
3. **Strategy Abstract:** Provides a top-level description of how the detection strategy being implemented functions by outlining what the alert will look for, the data sources, enrichment resources and ways of reducing false positives.
    
4. **Technical Context:** Describes the technical environment of the detection to be used, providing analysts and responders with all the information needed to understand the alert. Security analysts should align this information with the platforms and tools for collecting and processing threat alerts.
    
5. **Blind Spots and Assumptions:** Describes any issues identified where suspicious activities may not trigger the strategy. Assumptions and blind spots help clarify ways the ADS may fail or be bypassed by an adversary.
    
6. **False Positives:** Outlines occurrences where alerts may be triggered due to misconfigurations or non-malicious activities within the environment. This makes it easy to configure your SIEM to limit alert generation to only targetted threats when pushed to production.
    
7. **Validation:** Every detection needs to be verified, and here, you can outline all the steps required to produce a true-positive event that would trigger the detection alert. Consider this a unit test, which can even be a script or scenario used to generate an alert. For an effective validation:
    
    - Develop a plan that will produce a true-positive outcome.
    - Document the process of the plan.
    - From the testing environment, test and trigger an alert.
    - Validate the strategy that triggered the alert.
  
8. **Priority:** Set up the alerting levels with which the detection strategy may be tagged. This section provides the details of the criteria used to set up the preferences, and it is separate from the alerting levels shown through the SIEM.
    
9. **Response:** Provides details of how to triage and investigate a detection alert. This information is helpful for analysts and responders to be able to prevent extreme repercussions.
