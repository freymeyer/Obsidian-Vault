Spam is just digital noise: annoying, but mostly harmless. Phishing, however, is a precision strike, in this case from Malhare’s Eggsploit Bunnies, crafted to deceive TBFC employees and open a path into the company’s defences.

Spam focuses on quantity over precision. Unlike phishing, which aims to deceive specific users, spam messages are sent in bulk to flood inboxes with unwanted marketing or irrelevant content. Their goal isn’t usually to steal data, but to push exposure or engagement.

Common intentions behind spam messages:

- **Promotion:** Advertising products, services, or events. Often unsolicited or low-quality.
- **Scams:** Spreading fake offers or “get rich quick” schemes to attract clicks.
- **Traffic generation (clickbait):** Driving users to external sites or boosting ad metrics.
- **Data harvesting:** Collecting active email addresses for future campaigns.
