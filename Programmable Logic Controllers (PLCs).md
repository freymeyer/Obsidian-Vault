# Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)

## What is a PLC?

A PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) is an industrial computer designed to control machinery and processes in real-world environments. Unlike a laptop or smartphone, PLCs are purpose-built machines engineered for extreme reliability and harsh conditions.

PLCs are designed to:

- **Survive harsh environments** - They operate flawlessly in extreme temperatures, constant vibration, dust, moisture, and electromagnetic interference.
- **Run continuously without failure** - PLCs operate 24/7 for years, sometimes decades, without rebooting. Industrial facilities can't afford downtime for software updates or system restarts.
- **Execute control logic in real-time** - PLCs respond to sensor inputs within milliseconds. These timing requirements are critical for safety and efficiency.
- **Interface directly with physical hardware** - PLCs connect directly to sensors (measuring temperature, pressure, position, weight) and actuators (motors, valves, switches, robotic arms). They speak the electrical language of industrial machinery.
