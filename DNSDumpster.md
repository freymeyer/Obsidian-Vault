# DNSDumpster

> **One-liner:** A free online tool for DNS reconnaissance that discovers subdomains, DNS records, and maps domain infrastructure.

## 🎯 What Is It?
DNSDumpster is a web-based [[Passive Reconnaissance]] tool that aggregates DNS information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive domain intelligence. Unlike basic tools like [[nslookup]] or [[Domain Information Groper (dig)]], DNSDumpster excels at **subdomain discovery** — finding subdomains that standard DNS queries cannot reveal.

## 🔍 How It Works

### Information Retrieved
| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **DNS Servers** | Authoritative name servers with IPs |
| **MX Records** | Mail servers with priority and IPs |
| **TXT Records** | SPF, DKIM, verification records |
| **A Records** | Host-to-IP mappings |
| **Subdomains** | Discovered subdomains not in standard DNS |
| **Geolocation** | Approximate server locations |
| **Host Provider** | ASN and hosting company info |

### Subdomain Discovery Methods
DNSDumpster finds subdomains through:
- Certificate Transparency logs
- Search engine indexing
- Historical DNS records
- Brute-force results from other sources
- Zone file analysis

### Output Features
- **Tabular View** — Organized DNS record tables
- **Graph Visualization** — Visual map of domain infrastructure
- **Export Options** — Download graph as image

## ⚔️ Offensive Use Cases
```
1. Target: example.com
2. Run DNSDumpster scan
3. Discover: dev.example.com, staging.example.com, vpn.example.com
4. Result: dev subdomain running outdated software → entry point
```

### Attack Scenarios
- **Forgotten Subdomains** — Dev/staging servers with weak security
- **Mail Server Mapping** — Identify targets for email attacks
- **Infrastructure Analysis** — Understand hosting and CDN setup
- **Shadow IT Discovery** — Find unauthorized services

## 🛡️ Detection & Prevention (Blue Team)

### You Cannot Detect DNSDumpster Queries
DNSDumpster uses cached/aggregated data — it doesn't touch your systems.

### Prevention Strategies
- **Audit Subdomains** — Regularly scan your own domains
- **Remove Unused Records** — Delete DNS entries for decommissioned services
- **Wildcard Certs Carefully** — Avoid exposing subdomain names
- **Monitor Certificate Transparency** — Know what's being logged
- **Internal DNS** — Keep sensitive hostnames off public DNS

## 🎤 Interview Angles

### Common Questions
- **Q: Why use DNSDumpster instead of dig or nslookup?**
  - A: DNSDumpster aggregates subdomain data from multiple sources that basic DNS queries can't access, revealing hidden subdomains.

- **Q: How can attackers use subdomain discovery?**
  - A: Find forgotten dev/staging servers, identify additional attack surface, map infrastructure for targeted attacks.

- **Q: As a defender, how would you use DNSDumpster?**
  - A: Audit your own domain to discover exposed subdomains, verify no unauthorized services are publicly visible.
