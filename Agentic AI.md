Agentic AI refers to AI with agency capabilities, meaning that they are not restricted by narrow instructions, but rather capable of acting to accomplish a goal with minimal supervision. For example, an agentic AI will try to:

- Plan multi-step plans to accomplish goals.
- Act on things (run tools, call APIs, copy files).
- Watch & adapt, adapting strategy when things fail or new knowledge is discovered.
