The attacker didn't rely on a critical zero-day. Instead, they began with a [[Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]] vulnerability. On its own, that bug only allowed them to make HTTP requests from the server. However, that was enough to access the AWS EC2 metadata service, retrieve IAM credentials, and use those credentials to download sensitive files from an S3 bucket. None of these issues were individually critical, but the way they were chained led to a massive data breach.
