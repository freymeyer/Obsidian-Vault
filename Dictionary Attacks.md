In a dictionary attack, the attacker uses a predefined list of potential passwords, known as a wordlist, and tests each one until the correct password is found. These wordlists often contain leaked passwords from previous breaches, common substitutions like **password123**, predictable combinations of names and dates, and other patterns that people frequently use. Because many users choose weak or common passwords, dictionary attacks are usually fast and highly effective.
