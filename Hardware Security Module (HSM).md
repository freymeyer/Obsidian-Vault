HSM is physical device designed to generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys securely. They provide a highly secure environment, protecting keys even if the surrounding system is compromised.

HSM offer tamper-resistant hardware that securely handles [[key generation]], encryption, decryption, and signing operations, ensuring that cryptographic keys do not leave the device in plaintext form.
