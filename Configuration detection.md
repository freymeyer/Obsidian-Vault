Configuration detection uses current knowledge of the known environment and infrastructure to identify misalignments. It crosses domains including network, asset or identity.

The benefits of using configuration detection are as follows:
- This is the easiest form of detection to create and maintain in static environments, but not in dynamic environments
- It detects all malicious activity under perfect conditions, but limited visibility reduces effectiveness.
- Individuals with different expertise can do it
- Easy to combine with other detections for [[forensics]] and [[response]], but frequent configuration changes can result in high false positive
