Malware analysis is the process of examining a malicious file to understand its functionality, operation, and methods for defence against it. By analysing a malicious file or application, we can see exactly how it operates, and therefore, know how to prevent it.

 Malware analysis can determine if the malware has ever infected another device. Instead of fearing malware, taking a proactive approach by translating technical findings into practical defensive measures and understanding how the malware fits into an attacker's techniques.
