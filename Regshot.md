Regshot is a widely used utility, especially when analysing malware on Windows. It works by creating two "snapshots" of the registry—one before the malware is run and another afterwards. The results are then compared to identify any changes.

Malware aims to establish persistence, meaning it seeks to run as soon as the device is switched on. A common technique for malware is to add a `Run` key into the registry, which is frequently used to specify which applications are automatically executed when the device is powered on.
