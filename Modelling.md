Threat detection under this type is done by defining baseline operations and activities and recording any deviations that occur. The primary assumption of this approach is that malicious activity can be sufficiently identified from benign activity.

The approach involves building an asset or activity profile that includes baseline events, time and data threshold. An in-depth look into baselining shall be discussed in the next task.

Some of the benefits and challenges of this detection method include the following:
- Used to identify unknown adversary activities due to model changes and not threat characteristics.
- Easy to maintain in very static environments.
