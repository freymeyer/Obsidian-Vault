Server Message Block (SMB) is a communication protocol[1] originally developed in 1983 by Barry A. Feigenbaum at IBM[2] and intended to provide shared access to files and printers across nodes on a network of systems running IBM's OS/2. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.
